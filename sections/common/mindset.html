    </h3>

    <p>
      My approach to technology is grounded in clarity, discipline, and continuous learning.
      I believe secure systems are not built by tools alone, but by understanding
      monitoring, failure patterns, and responsible design.

      With an academic foundation in Cyber Security and practical exposure to
      Cloud and Backend systems, I focus on:

    <ul>
      <li>Designing systems with security and observability in mind</li>

      <li>Learning industry practices aligned with global standards</li>
    </ul>
