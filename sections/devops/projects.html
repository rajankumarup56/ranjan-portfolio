    <h4>AWS CloudTrail – CloudWatch Security Monitoring</h4>
    <p>
      Designed and implemented a cloud monitoring setup using AWS CloudTrail and
      CloudWatch to track API activity, detect security-relevant events,
      and trigger alerts for suspicious behavior.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled CloudTrail for account-level logging</li>
      <li>Integrated logs with CloudWatch Log Groups</li>
      <li>Created metric filters and alarms</li>
      <li>Configured SNS notifications for alerts</li>

    <h4>AI-Driven DevOps Monitoring (Conceptual Project)</h4>
    <p>
      Worked on a conceptual monitoring model exploring how anomaly patterns
      in logs and metrics can assist proactive incident detection
      in DevOps environments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied incident patterns from logs</li>
      <li>Mapped monitoring signals to potential failures</li>
      <li>Aligned concepts with real-world DevOps practices</li>
